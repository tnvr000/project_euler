# check out the palindrome formula
# The palindrome can be written as
# 11(9091a + 910b + 100c) = mn;
# a,b & c being 1 digit integers and m & n being 3 digit integers.
# Let 11 * 10 < m < 11 * 90;

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of
# two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# add custom methods to integer class
class Integer
  # returns true if the number read same both forward and backward
